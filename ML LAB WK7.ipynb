Westwood Forward's campaign was focused on addressing a range of issues that included affordable housing and entrepreneurship, but did not specifically oppose restrictions on housing developments and restaurants.  \\n10.

      "\"Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.\" - This statement is false, as the term \"machine intelligence\" is not attributed to Alan Turing and he was not the first person to conduct substantial research in what is now known as artificial intelligence. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.\" - This statement is false as the AI winter refers primarily to a period of reduction in the funding and interest in artificial intelligence during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s ...\" - This statement is false as there is no defined period known as the \"AI spring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.\" - The definition of General intelligence in AI context is not completely correct. It refers to an artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at the level of a human or beyond. It does not imply completion of any task a human can perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action.\" - This statement is false. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) does not supply the utility of each state and cost of each action. It includes a reward function that supplies a reward for each action-state pair. The reward does not explicitly have to do with the cost of an action.\n",

      "2. UCLA does not enroll 14,300 graduate and professional students annually. As of Fall 2021, the graduate student enrollment was approximately 13,000.\n",
      "3. The schools offering undergraduate degree programs at UCLA are not limited to Arts and Architecture, Engineering and Applied Science, Music, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Theater, Film and Television. There are others like the School of the Environment and Sustainability and the Herb Alpert School of Music.\n",
      "4. UCLA Bruins have won 118 NCAA team championships, not 121.\n",
      "5. UCLA has not been represented in every Olympics since the university's founding. It has been represented in every Olympics since 1920.\n",
      "6. The Southern Branch of the University of California did not open on September 15, 1919. It opened on September 15, 1929.\n",
      "7. In 1929, UCLA did not hold undergraduate classes with 5,500 students. The student population was around 4,000.\n",
      "8. UCLA was not permitted to award the master's degree in 1933 and the doctorate in 1936. It was permitted to award advanced degrees starting in 1931.\n",
      "9. The state did not break ground in Westwood in 1927. Ground was broken for the new campus in 1927 in Westwood.\n",
      "10. UCLA was not treated as an off-site department of UC Berkeley for its first 32 years. It was a branch campus with its own administration, faculty, and students.\n",
      "11. The first chief executive of UCLA to be granted the title of chancellor was not Raymond B. Allen. It was Clarence Dykstra in 1950.\n",
      "12. The murder-suicide at UCLA occurred on June 2, 2016, not June 1, 2016.\n",
      "13. The Westwood Neighborhood Council was not split into a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council in 2018, it was in April 2017. \n",
      "14. UCLA did not sign an agreement to partner with the Tongva tribe for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus in 2022. There is no official record of such an agreement.\n"
